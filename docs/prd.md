# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Objective
Create a system that monitors and analyzes GitHub repositories starred by users who have also starred repositories that the current user has starred. This will help users discover new, relevant repositories based on shared interests within their GitHub network.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to authenticate with my GitHub account so the system can access my starred repositories.
- As a user, I want to see a list of repositories starred by people who have also starred my starred repos.
- As a user, I want to filter the discovered repositories by programming language, topics, and date last updated.
- As a user, I want to see how many mutual stargazers each discovered repository has.
- As a user, I want to star new repositories directly from the application.
- As a user, I want to receive weekly email digests of newly discovered repositories.
- As a user, I want to exclude certain repositories or users from the analysis.
- As a user, I want to see a visualization of the star network connecting repositories.

## Features
1. GitHub OAuth integration for user authentication
2. Repository discovery algorithm
3. Filtering and sorting options for discovered repos
4. Star count and mutual stargazer metrics
5. In-app starring functionality
6. Email digest system

8. Network visualization

## Technical Requirements
1. Use GitHub API v4 (GraphQL) for efficient data retrieval
2. Implement a backend service for data processing and storage
3. Create a responsive web frontend for user interaction
4. Set up a scheduled job for regular data updates and email digests
