# Coding Conventions for GitHub Star Network Monitor

## Project Overview
This document outlines the conventions and best practices for developing the GitHub Star Network Monitor project. Adhering to these conventions will help ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.

## General Coding Conventions

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level; do not use tabs.
   - Limit lines to 79 characters.
   - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
   - Use `CamelCase` for class names.
   - Use all uppercase letters for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).

3. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Use docstrings to describe the purpose of functions, classes, and modules.
   - Write clear and concise comments for complex logic.
   - Maintain a comprehensive `README.md` file with setup and usage instructions.

## Technologies and Libraries

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for building APIs
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic for input/output validation
- **HTTP Client**: aiohttp for making asynchronous HTTP requests
- **Testing**: pytest for unit testing

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state
- **UI Components**: Material-UI for pre-built components
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing

### Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage

### Caching
- **Cache**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data

## API Design Guidelines

1. **RESTful Principles**
   - Use nouns for resource names (e.g., `/repositories`, `/users`).
   - Use HTTP methods appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - Use plural nouns for resource names.

2. **Response Format**
   - Use JSON as the response format.
   - Include meaningful HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).

3. **Versioning**
   - Version the API using a prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/`).

## Testing Conventions

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all non-trivial functions and methods.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
- Use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., API calls, database interactions) when testing.

### Integration Tests
- Write integration tests for API endpoints.
- Test interactions between components (e.g., frontend and backend).
- Ensure edge cases and error handling are covered.

## Security Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Use OAuth 2.0 for GitHub authentication.
   - Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in environment variables.

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
   - Sanitize data before processing.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Version Control

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for development (e.g., `feature/user-auth`).
   - Merge branches into `main` using pull requests.

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
   - Use the format: `TYPE: Subject` (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`).

3. **Code Reviews**
   - Conduct code reviews for all pull requests to ensure code quality and adherence to conventions.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
   - Run tests automatically on pull requests.

2. **Linting**
   - Use linters (e.g., flake8 for Python) as part of the CI process to enforce coding standards.

## Documentation

- Keep all documentation up to date, including API documentation and user guides.
- Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to generate API documentation automatically.

## Conclusion
By following these conventions, we can ensure that the GitHub Star Network Monitor project remains organized, maintainable, and scalable. All team members are encouraged to adhere to these guidelines and contribute to improving them as needed.
